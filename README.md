This is a website application for predicting Amazon Stock data.

This web app utilized neural networks in order to create a model to predict stock prices. Here we use a specific algorithm,
Long Short Term Memory. This is the preferred choice for our model due to the fact that there is inherent need for past data to factor into
decisions for future data. 


There is also functionality to predict new instances of data using the model that we have created
