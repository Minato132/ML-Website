In mani.py, the get_dates() function will return 9 different things

The Training Set: Dates, X Matrix, y value
The Validation Set: Dates, X Matrix, y value
The Test Set: Dates, X Matrix, y value

The LSTM model here uses KERAS as the model in order to create layers of neural nets, each 
with an activation function. 

In the get_model() function, we need to input The Training Set
of X and y along. It takes the X and y training set along with the X and y validation set.
Input also the learning rate, and the number of times the network should be reran
    lr = .001
    num = 100
These are base values that you can try

We are allowed to predict the validation set 
or the test set. In either case, make sure to use the X Matrix as our training instances.
